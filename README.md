# Dashboard for MAIA AMOD/S Device Data Visualization

## Viewing options

You can view this app using RStudio on your local machine. You will need an internet connection.
Run the following code.
```r
# Install shiny if not already installed
install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
runGitHub(repo = "maia_dashboard", username = "mariacardelino", ref = "main")
```
If it is still hosted on my server, it will be visible at https://mcardelino.shinyapps.io/CEAMS/ .
We are attempting to move this to Github Pages.
